meterpreter for nexus 5
===================================
me I have installed nethunter u can find tutorials on youtube. Also u can install kali via termux app, in a rooted nexus 5 armhf witch is "32bit" to check architecture of your android phone type uname -a

secondly I tried to install PowerShell from repositories but I was lazy to search so found this https://github.com/PowerShell/Powershell and I download powershell-7.0.0-linux-arm32.tar.gz file of armhf and i installed it using tar xzvf (yourfile).tar.gz

before u do this create a folder, mkdir anyname and extract it inside when its done just git clone the meterpreter and copy/paste files inside the folder where u have extracted PowerShell packages u can run ./pwsh meterpreter.ps1, and u are done.


1ยบ have nethunter or kali Linux on android
2ยบ download Raspbian (Stretch) Experimental | 32-bit tar.gz file which is compatible with armhf
here compare the architecture u have to know uname -a create a folder put the downloaded powershell-7.0.0-linux-arm32.tar.gz and git clone meterpreter also copy what it contains in the created folder give permission by using this command chmod +x *
3ยบ run it by ./pwsh meterpreter.ps1 and then put ur local host to know it open a terminal and type ifconfig eg 192.168.1.88 and port any eg 8080 , start apache2 (service apache2 start) and give permission to update564165456.zip and the update1651651.bat ,1 method open terminal cd var/www/html and then ls chmod +x * , or use a root file explorer and select both file go to permission and click all , send zip to victim he extract it and run , and u have a meterpreter ,its clean but some entiviruses as 360 detelect powershell.exe in processes and won't allow it to run i did not try other entiviruses as windefender etc or Kaspersky.. sorry for my English i hope this helped.
